**** ALIGNN
- much more accessible code-base
  - more familiar core dependencies
  - more extensible

- is this generated from the atomistic graph as an input?
- is this created within the network?
** Comparison to other crystalgraph implmentations
- Materials Project's MEGnet uses some kind of crystal graph too.
* ALIGNN Performance on Perovskites Data
** pre-trained

** training
requires GPU resources -- can't do this on time

create adversary to generate materials for ALIGNN predictions
- first, encoder/generator paradigm
- second, "BiGAN" encoder-generator may extend designer to consider
  fabrication constraints.
  - a type of auto-encoder
