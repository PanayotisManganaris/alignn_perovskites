* ALIGNN Performance on Perovskites Data
# bad figures, but improvements to come

create adversary to generate materials for ALIGNN predictions
- creating a generator adversary
- ALIGNN as a discriminator?
- encoder/generator paradigm with ALIGNN as encoder
- "BiGAN" encoder-generator may extend adversary to consider
  additional constraints in material generation.
  - a type of auto-encoder
